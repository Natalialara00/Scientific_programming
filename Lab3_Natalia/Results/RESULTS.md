# Results

This folder contains the outputs generated from the data analysis and visualization processes. It is organized into two main subdirectories:

**Tables/**: Includes the results of feature extraction and statistical analyses such as Shapiro-Wilk, Wilcoxon, and ANOVA. These tables provide insight into the distribution of the data and highlight significant differences between experimental conditions.

**Figures/:** Contains visual representations of the processed data. This includes the original transmission spectra and the spectra annotated with the most relevant peaks—those used for feature extraction. Additionally, it includes heatmaps, KDE plots, and histograms that visually explore the data’s separability and the distribution of key features.
