This folder contains the core scripts used for data preprocessing, spectral analysis including peak shifts and sensitivity calculationsand statistical evaluation. It also includes modules for generating visualizations based on the processed data.

To ensure modularity and reusability, the code is structured using object-oriented programming. Several classes were defined, each with multiple methods designed to streamline the execution of tasks and facilitate parameter reuse across the project.
